    <h4>Bhavaya Builder</h4>
    </a>

    <p>The Bhavaya Builder application quickly allows you to view the
       contents of your database and can be used as a starting
       point for real-time, customised viewing of database data.
       <a href="../builder/builder.jnlp" title="Start Bhavaya Builder">Start</a>
       the builder application and then click on
       the plus sign to add a new database configuration. The
       resulting window, filled in for a <a
       href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/">hsqldb</a> database, is
       shown below.</p>

    <p><center><img src="../images/builder_config.png"></center></p>

    <p>The id and name can be chosen by the user. The database entries
       should be altered to reflect the database that you're using (NB
       real-time mode is currently only supported for Sybase).  You
       will need to click the ellipsis to the right of the
       catalogue/schema option, at this point the application will
       connect to your database, so it must be available for this
       step. You can choose a Schema or simply click in the empty
       window and then click OK. You must do this even if you chose a
       "blank" schema. Once done, click create.</p>

    <p>In the main builder window, select the database entry that
       you've just added, so that it is highlighted.  Click on
       generate (cogs to the left of the green arrow) and then run
       (the green arrow).</p>

    <p>Once Bhavaya starts, click on the Collections <a
       href="../split_panel.html">Split Panel</a>. In the panel that
       appears you should see entries for each table in your
       database.</p>

    <p>Right click on a table name and select view all. Then bring up
       the edit split panel by clicking its label on the right hand
       side and select the columns (properties) from the database that
       you wish to view.</p>

    <h5>&nbsp;Configuring the real-time connection</h5>

    <p> A .bhavayaBuilder directory should have been created on your
        system. It will have been created in c:\ if you used
        JavaWebStart to run the program, or in your home directory
        (HOMEDRIVE for Windows XP) if you downloaded and ran the code
        locally. Open this directory and navigate to application.xml
        which should be in a directory below one with the ID you chose
        in the builder application and then below a resources
        directory. Open the application.xml file in a text editor (in
        windows, right click and then select edit) and then follow the
        <a href="persistence.html">persistence layer instructions</a>.</p>
