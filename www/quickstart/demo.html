    <h4>The Demo Application</h4>
    </a>

    <p>The Demo Application illustrates how Bhavaya could be used. It
       provides a real-time GUI view of data in a self-contained
       active database.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      
      <li>When <a href="../builder/demo.jnlp" title="launch bhavaya
          demo">launched</a> the demo application should show trades as
          they happen in the "Trades - All" tab.</li>
      
      <li>Switching to the "Positions - All" tab (by clicking its
          name) will display the effects of the trades (that are
          appearing in the "Trades - All" tab) on, for example, the
          price of a given traded instrument.</li>

       <li>The cells can be seen flashing when their content
           changes.</li>
       
       <li>The "Collections", "Configurations" and "Edit" labels on
           the left and right edges of the screen can be clicked to
           bring up new windows. These are Bhavaya's <a
           href="../split_panel.html">Tabbed Split Panels</a>
           component. </li>

    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>Two of the application's capabilities, that may be
       useful to users of the software, are highlighted below.</p>

    <h5>&nbsp;Display position for all trades in Euros</h5>

      <p>
        <ul>
	  
	  <li>Open the Collections menu and double click on the
              positions entry that appears. This will bring up another
              window, where you can enter a name for this grouping
              e.g.  Euros.</li>

	  <li>Click the plus button and select currency, then
              highlight EUR, click the right arrow and click OK.</li>

	  <li>Double click on the Euros entry that should have
              appeared under the positions tree in the collections
              tab.</li>

	 </ul>
       </p> 

       <p>You should now have a new table called "Positions - Euros",
          which only shows trades in Euros. The information displayed
          in this table can be configured using the "Edit" split
          panel, which has check-boxes for the information available
          for positions (these are actually the properties of the
          synthesised positions class).</p>

    <h5>&nbsp;Display the total value of instruments grouped by maturity date and categorised by currency</h5>

      <p>Configure the application to only display the relevant
         properties:</p>

      <p>
        <ul>

	  <li>Click on the "Positions - all" tab. Then open up the
              edit split panel, by clicking on the edit label on the
              right.</li>
	      
	  <li>Expand the Instrument and Bond Future tree, and remove
              the First Delivery Date tick.</li>

	  <li>Also remove Quantity and Timestamp, and from
              Instrument/Currency remove: Description, Instrument Type
              and Price. Expand the Currency tree and click on
              code.</li>

	 </ul>
       </p>

      <p>Pivot the data by currency, by clicking on the toggle
         pivoting button (menu bar, table with a highlighted blue top
         row and green left row).</p>

      <p>Switch on grouping, using the menu bar item with two red
         arrows and then display the amount in each currency using the
         Edit panel Quantity tree and checking amount.</p>

      <p>Switch the date series on by clicking on the Sigma symbol in
         the menu bar.</p>

     <p>Experiment with the effect of the other buttons ...</p>

     <p>The positions tab can be undocked from the main window, by
        right-clicking its name and selecting Undock Tab as
        Window. </p>
