  <h4>The Persistence Layer - Specifying classes to be inflated
      from the database</h4>
 
  <p>This example describes how to create a class that obtains some of
     its properties from a database, and refers to the code contained
     within the example directories available from <a
     href="../downloads/examples.zip">examples.zip</a>.</p>

  <p>Any class which has properties inflated from database data should
     implement the org.bhavaya.util.Observable interface and support
     the firePropertyChange methods described later. These methods are
     needed to provide the real-time functionality, however, as a
     starting point it is only necessary to make the class a sub-class
     of org.bhavaya.util.DefaultObservable. The new class may also
     implement the org.bhavaya.beans.LifeCycle interface, which has
     methods called at various points in a bean's life-cycle and is
     described <a href="persist_lifecycle.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Bhavaya class properties follow the Java Beans convention and are
     derived from the class's getter and setter methods. e.g. if a
     class has methods getFoo and setFoo, then it is assumed to have a
     property foo. If the properties are determined from database data
     then the getter and setter methods must be implemented as
     abstract methods within the class. Example2 contains an
     Instrument class (<a
     href="../examples/beans/Instrument.java">Instrument.java</a>),
     which follows these conventions.</p>

  <p>The mapping between class properties and database data is
     contained in the <a href="schema2.xml.txt">schema.xml</a> file. In
     turn, the schema to be used is specified in the <a
     href="application2.xml.txt">application.xml</a> file by adding
     the tag:<pre>
     &lt;property key="schema" value="schema.xml"/&gt;</pre></p>

  <p>The format of the schema file should be intuitive. The datasource
     for the class (as defined in application.xml), and the mapping
     between the class's properties and database columns is
     specified. The format used is described completely <a
     href="schema.html">here</a>.</p>

  <h5>&nbsp;Instantiating objects of generated classes</h5>

  <p><a href="../examples/example2/Example2.java">Example2.java</a> uses the
     schema.xml and application.xml files discussed above. Objects of
     classes are obtained from a BeanFactory
     (org.bhavaya.beans.BeanFactory) for the class in
     question. e.g.<pre>
     BeanFactory instrumentFactory = BeanFactory.getInstance(Instrument.class);</pre>
  </p>

  <p>Obtains a factory for objects of the Instrument class. Objects
     created in this way will commonly be referred to as beans throughout
     these webpages. Beans (and
     collections of beans) can be obtained from this factory using a
     number of techniques. The simplest of which is to use the
     database primary key that relates to the bean: 
  <pre>     Instrument instrument = (Instrument) instrumentFactory.get(new Integer(3)); </pre></p>

   <p>which retrieves an instrument bean using values from the
     database row that has an integer primary key of 3. If you run
     Example2 you should see output similar to:<pre>
     Found resource: file:/C:/Projects/WWWBeanFactoryTesting/./resources2/application2.xml
     Found resource: file:/C:/Projects/WWWBeanFactoryTesting/./resources2/createExample2.sql
     Found resource: file:/C:/Projects/WWWBeanFactoryTesting/./resources2/schema2.xml
     instrument description = M&amp;S 7.75 30/12/2003
     Price = 8.96 VAT Price = 10.53
     Setting price to 5.99
     instrument description = M&amp;S 7.75 30/12/2003
     Price = 5.99 VAT Price = 7.04
     Found resource: file:/C:/Projects/WWWBeanFactoryTesting/./resources2/destroyExample2.sql
</pre></p>

  <p>The code uses instrument's setters and getters to obtain its
     description and price. Price is obtained from the database,
     whereas the current VAT rate is a standard class property. The
     setters only apply to the current bean and do not update the
     values in the database.</p>

  <p>After briefly reviewing the <a href="schema.html">schema file
     format</a>, you should be in a position to modify the schema and
     class files to extract and use classes from tables in your
     database.</p>

  <a name="foreign">
  <h5>&nbsp;Class members that are also classes 1 - linking tables
      via foreign keys</h5></a>

  <p>Generated classes can have properties that return objects of
     other generated classes. Example3 includes a <a
     href="../examples/beans/Currency.java">Currency</a> class, and
     also adds a currency table to the database (the instrument table
     is also modified to include the currency table foreign key
     constraint). A type definition for currency has also been added
     to the <a href="schema3.xml.txt">schema</a> file.</p>

  <p>The two classes are tied together by adding a foreign key
     property to the type definition for the Instrument class in the
     schema file, and a corresponding abstract getCurrency() method to
     the <a href="../examples/beans/Instrument.java">Instrument</a>
     class.<a
     href="../examples/example3/Example3.java">Example3.java</a> simply
     prints out one of the currency entries to illustrate this
     functionality.</p>

  <p>A foreign key property need not be unique, i.e. it may return a BeanCollection
     rather than just a single Bean. In this case the foreignKeyProperty has cardinality="MANY"
     and the abstract bean has getters and setters for a collection and a getter for an array i.e.</p>

  <p><pre>
     public abstract ReportAttachment[] getReportAttachments();
     public abstract BeanCollection getReportAttachmentsCollection();
     public abstract void setReportAttachmentsCollection(BeanCollection collection);

     &lt;foreignKeyProperty name="reportAttachments"
            type="org.somewhere.ReportAttachment"
            cardinality="MANY"
            foreignIndex="byReport" &lt;!-- the indexing rule would by specified in reportAttachments schema entry --&gt;
            lazy="true">
            &lt;column name="id"/&gt;
     &lt;/foreignKeyProperty&gt;
  </pre></p>

  <a name="subclasses">
  <h5>&nbsp;Subclasses (Joining tables)</h5></a>

  <p>Generated classes can be subclasses of other generated
     classes. <a
     href="../examples/example4/Example4.java">Example4</a> has a <a
     href="../examples/beans/Bond.java">Bond</a> class which is a
     subclass of <a
     href="../examples/beans/Instrument.java">Instrument</a>. The
     subclass should be added in the same way as any other class:
     there must be a table for it in the database and its type
     definition should be added to the schema file.</p>

  <p>The relationship is implemented at the database level and in the
     schema.xml file. The subclass database table (bond) has a foreign
     key reference to its parent table (instrument) and both class's
     definitions in the schema file have additional entries. <a
     href="schema4.xml.txt">schema4.xml</a> contains these
     modifications. The parent class (instrument) type definition
     has a subClassMappings tag, and the Bond type tag contains
     a reference to the superType. The sql for generating Bonds is
     also a join on the two tables.</p>

  <p>Bond beans can be obtained from a BeanFactory for
     Instrument.class or Bond.class. In the case of a BeanFactory for
     Instrument.class, returned beans can be Instruments or Bonds
     (depending on the key used for retrieval) with the expected
     polymorphic behaviour.</p>

  <a name="constructorproperty">
  <h5>&nbsp;Class members that are also classes 2 -
      constructorProperty</h5></a>

  <p>Generated classes can have properties that return objects of
     other classes, where the returned class is not itself based on a
     database table. The constructor and the data used to instantiate
     the returned class is specified, allowing some of the returned
     class's properties to be set using data from the database.</p>

  <p>The schema file is again used via a constructorProperty tag.
     This tag contains nested tags describing the sources for the
     constructor's arguments. Each nested tag specifies its return
     type, so that the correct constructor can be used. Values for the
     constructor can be obtained from a bean's existing properties
     (which may be foreign) or from a database column, or they can be
     a fixed value.</p>

  <p><a href="../examples/example5/Example5.java">Example5</a>
     demonstrates the use of a constructor property for the <a
     href="../examples/beans/Quantity.java">Quantity</a>
     class. The Schema file has the following additional entries:<pre>
        &lt;constructorProperty name="instrumentQuantity" type="Quantity"&gt;
            &lt;defaultValue value="5" type="int"/&gt;
            &lt;column name="PRICE" source="instrumentQuantity.price" type="double"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="currency.code" type="java.lang.String"/&gt;
            &lt;defaultValue value="T" type="java.util.Date"/&gt;
        &lt;/constructorProperty&gt;</pre>
     </p>

  <p>This defines a property of an Instrument bean to be
     instrumentQuantity whose return type is Quantity. It will be
     constructed using Quantity(int, double, String, Date) with fixed
     values, values obtained from the database, and from instrument's
     foreignKey property currency. The full syntax is described in the
     <a href="schema.html#constructorProperty">schema file format</a>.</p>
