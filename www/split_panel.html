  <h4>Tabbed Split Panels</h4>
  
  <p>Bhavaya TabbedSplitPanels (org.bhavaya.ui.TabbedSplitPanel)
     provide a JPanel derivative that can be subdivided (split) into
     two or more Components when a button is pressed. They can be
     viewed as providing a pop-up, or drawer feature to a main
     component. The pop-up component compresses the main component
     when both are displayed. The TabbedSplitPanel is illustrated
     below. The figure on the left has non of it's pop-up components
     activated, there is a blank central JPanel acting as the main
     component and there are buttons on the left, right and bottom
     edges of the window. The figure on the right is the result when
     some of the split panels have been activated. JTextAreas have
     been used as the pop-up component and the figure also shows how
     TabbedSplitPanels can be nested within one another.</p>

  <p>The TabbedSplitPanel demo was used to generate the above two
     figures, it can be <a
     href="builder/tabbed-split-panel.jnlp">run directly</a> using
     JavaWebStart. Alternatively if you have Bhavaya's library files
     in your classpath you can compile and run the <a
     href="examples/TabbedSplitPanelDemo.java">source</a> directly, or
     if you have downloaded and extracted <a
     href="downloads/examples.zip">examples.zip</a> it can be run with:
     ant tabbedsplitpaneldemo</p>

  <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage guide</h5>

  <p>Constructor summary:
    <pre>  TabbedSplitPanel(Component mainPanel, int orientation)</pre>
  </p>

  <p>The <em>mainPanel</em> is the centrally displayed object. Next to
     this the TabbedSplitPanel creates a gutter. The gutter is where
     the buttons that activate the split panel will be placed. The
     position of the gutter relative to the <em>mainPanel</em> is
     controlled by <em>orientation</em> and can be
     <em>TabbedSplitPanel.LEFT</em>, <em>TabbedSplitPanel.RIGHT</em>
     and <em>TabbedSplitPanel.BOTTOM</em>.</p>

  <p>The buttons and the component that they activate are added using
     objects of the MenuPanel class.</p>

  <p>MenuPanel constructor summary:</p>

  <p>
    <pre>  MenuPanel(String name, Component component, boolean autoTitle)</pre>
  </p>

  <p>The <em>name</em> is the text for the button created in the
     gutter, it is also (optionally) the heading used for the pop-up
     component (if <em>autoTitle</em> is true). <em>component</em> is
     the Component that is activated and displayed when the MenuPanel
     is activated.
  </p>

  <p>MenuPanels are added using
     TabbedSplitPanel.addMenuPanel(menuPanel) and the number of
     MenuPanels that can be added is not limited by the software.
  </p>

  <p>An example of how to use the TabbedSplitPanel is shown below:</p>

  <p><pre>
        JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();
        TabbedSplitPanel centrePanel = new TabbedSplitPanel(mainPanel,TabbedSplitPanel.RIGHT);
        
        MenuPanel menuPanel = new MenuPanel("Right Menu", new JTextArea("Menu panel for right tabbed split panel"),true);
        centrePanel.addMenuPanel(menuPanel);
	
	frame.setContentPane(centrePanel)
  </pre></p>

  <p>where </em>frame</em> is a previously created JFrame.</p>

  <p>This will create an empty centre panel, with a button labelled
     <em>Right menu</em> in a gutter on the right-hand side. When
     clicked the button brings up a JTextArea, also on the right-hand
     side.</p>

<p>(When using this component remember to add Bhavaya's jar files to
    your classpath (extract_location/bhavaya/bin/bhavaya.jar and
    extract_location/bhavaya/lib/log4j-1.2.15-patched.jar).)</p>

<!--
 <p>To use this component it is necessary to:
    <ul>
      <li>Add Bhavaya's jar files to your classpath
          (extract_location/bhavaya/bin/bhavaya.jar and
          extract_location/bhavaya/lib/log4j-1.2.15-patched.jar).</li>
      <li>Add the lines <pre>
      import javax.swing.*;
      import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
      import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
      import org.bhavaya.ui.*;</pre>
 
      to your source file.</li>
    </ul>

<!--<p>Three objects are required:
<ul>

<li>A <b>SplitPanel</b>. This is the top level
object and replaces the top level view component that would
otherwise have been used. The original top level object is given to
the SplitPanel's constructor.</li>

<li>A <b>SplitControlPanel</b>.The class consists of a gutter and a
 component that acts as the main view.  The gutter can be aligned on
 the left, right or bottom of the panel.  This class also contains a
 reference to the SplitPanel which this class is responsible for
 controlling. </li>

<li>Any number of <b>MenuPanel</b>s. A MenuPanel defines the contents
of the panel displayed when it is activated.</li>

</ul>

    <p>Split panel constructor:
    <pre>SplitPanel(Component component, int orientation)</PRE>

    component: The Component that the split panel will will pop out
    over
<br>
orientation: SplitPanel.[LEFT||BOTTOM||RIGHT] The place where the
panel will appear when activated

</p>

<p><pre>
SplitControlPanel(int orientation, SplitPanel splitPanel, Component
component)</pre>

orientation. The location of the gutter.  Can be SplitPanel.LEFT,
RIGHT or BOTTOM. The gutter is the area of the screen where the
buttons will appear that allow the split panel to be activated.
    
 
splitPanel The SplitPanel that this class will be controlling.  This
is most often also the component.
 

component The component that sits next to the gutter (the main view).
This is often the splitpanel.

</p>


<p><pre>
MenuPanel(String name, Component component, int orientation, boolean
autoTitle) </pre>

name: The name of this menu. Will be used for the menu's button in the
gutter, and optionally (dependent on autoTitle) for the menu's main
heading when the panel is activated.

component: This component will be displayed when the menu is
activated. This can be another SplitControlPanel, enabling you to nest
split panels within split panels.

orientation: Not sure what this does.
