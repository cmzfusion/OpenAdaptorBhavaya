<h3>Bhavaya Overview</h3>

      <p>The functionality provided by the complete Bhavaya package is
         introduced here, where its use as a real-time database viewer
         is described. Bhavaya encapsulates a persistence layer and a
         GUI optimised for displaying data that changes. These
         features and others are discussed in the <a
         href="architecture.html">architecture</a> section, which
         covers the software's components and is intended for
         developers who want to use just some of Bhavaya's
         features.</p>

    <h4>Bhavaya demo</h4>

      <p>The Bhavaya demo application showcases the software's main
         features. It is self-contained and can be <a
         href="builder/demo.jnlp" title="launch bhavaya demo">launched
         directly</a> using JavaWebStart. A brief guide to using the
         demo application is given in the <a
         href="quickstart/demo.html">Quickstart</a> section.</p>

      <p><center><img src="images/demo.png"></center></p>

      <p><center><em>Screen shot of the Bhavaya demo
        application</em></center></p>

      <!-- <p> The demo uses Bhavaya's persistence layer <B>ADD
           ANCHOR</B> to retrieve dynamic java objects from the
           database. The objects are then displayed using classes
           inherited from standard swing components that are optimised
           for displaying transient data.</p> -->

       <p>The Data Collections tab on the left shows the classes that
          are available from the database. Bhavaya can be configured
          to synthesise and display classes from the database
          automatically (according to its contents) or in conjunction
          with requirements specified by the user. The classes
          synthesised in the demo application are from a database
          containing information about bond trades. The data
          collections tab allows criteria to be specified that
          determine which objects of these classes (obtained from the
          database data) are displayed in the spreadsheet-like area in
          the centre of the application. Spreadsheet cells are flashed
          when their corresponding database data changes. The
          right-hand Edit tab allows the user to specify which
          properties of the class (synthesised from database columns)
          are displayed. For more information about the persistence
          layer and Bhavaya's class synthesis click <a
          href="architecture.html#persistence_layer">here</a>. (The
          demo application contains an in-memory database whose
          content is changing in real-time as the program runs,
          simulating a real-world database connection.)</p>

       <p>There is an undocked spreadsheet tab in the lower left-hand
          corner. This tab shows an aggregated view of the data, and
          highlights the application's sorting and grouping
          functions. Each row displays the total value of all bonds
          that mature within a specific time frame.</p>

       <p>Bhavaya, used in this fashion, provides a real-time database
          viewer. MS Excel or MS Access users will recognise some of
          Bhavaya's features as part of the functionality available in
          database browsers and spreadsheets.  Without writing any
          code, you can point Bhavaya at a database, select a table,
          load the data from the table into a grid widget in a
          spreadsheet-like application and then sort, group, pivot and
          graph it. What is different about Bhavaya is that, once you
          have created this configuration it is possible to use
          Bhavaya as a real-time application - i.e. you can track the
          changes to the data as they are happening in the
          database. This solves one of the perennial problems of
          database browsers and spreadsheets - that they tend to
          &quot;snapshot&quot; the data they display, and so need a
          system to be built around them to keep them
          up-to-date. Bhavaya does this automatically, by monitoring
          either the logs or audit trail of the database.</p>

       <h4>Bhavaya Builder</h4>

       <p>The <a href="builder/builder.jnlp" title="Start Bhavaya
          Builder">Bhavaya Builder application</a> (launches via
          JavaWebStart) provides a simple interface for creating a
          real-time view of database data using Bhavaya and its
          GUI. It is not necessary to write any code to get a view of
          the database data up and running, allowing non-developers to
          browse the data in their database. However, users will need
          to know the jdbc connection parameters for their database and
          technical work is required to set up the notification
          mechanism from the database to enable the real-time
          functionality. Quickstart instructions for using Bhavaya
          Builder can be found <a href="quickstart/builder.html">here</a>.</p>
