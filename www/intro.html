<h3>Bhavaya Home</h3>

<p>Bhavaya is a Java library that provides real-time and up-to-date
   access to database data. It contains a persistence layer that
   inflates and maintains Java objects from database data, keeping the
   objects current with the data. The library also provides a large
   number of user interface and utility classes often required when
   dealing with continually changing data.</p>

<p>The Bhavaya persistence layer is different from other
   implementations such as <a
   href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and <a href="
   http://castor.exolab.org/">Castor</a> in that the properties of
   Bhavaya's objects always reflect the current value of the data in
   the database. That is, if the database data changes then the data
   in Bhavaya's objects is automatically updated. Bhavaya does not
   require any pre-existing architecture, it can be used, easily,
   with existing databases and existing object schemas.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the library is a fully-functioning database
   viewer. Alternatively, any of its components may be added to an
   existing application. For example, the Bhavaya persistence layer
   could be added to an application that previously snap-shotted
   database data to give it real-time functionality.</p>


<!--
<p>Bhavaya is a persistence layer that holds real-time database data
   in Java objects. Storing the data in Java objects means that the
   full power of the Java VM and its extensive libraries and functions
   are available to you to manipulate and display the data.</p>

<p>What sets Bhavaya apart from other solutions is that if the data in
   the database changes, then so does the data in the Java
   objects. This means the properties in the objects in the Java VM
   always reflect the current values of the appropriate database row,
   rather than the values the database row had when you started the
   application.</p>

<p>Bhavaya also contains several GUI implementations for displaying
   the data in the Java objects. You can use the default GUI classes
   'out of the box' to create views of the data, or you can build on
   the basic GUI classes to customise your applications.</p>
