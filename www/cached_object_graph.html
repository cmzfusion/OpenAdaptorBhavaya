    <h4>Cached Object Graph</h4>

    <p>This class allows monitoring of a collection of properties of
       objects of a given class, where each object's properties are
       observable<sup>1</sup> and may result from objects of other
       observable classes. Thus, each object's properties may change
       indirectly as its sub-owned objects change, furthermore, these
       sub-changes may happen asynchronously. The inter-relationship
       between the main object and its dependent objects can be viewed
       as a graph. Cached Object Graph provides a thread-safe way of
       monitoring a graph of observable objects. </p>

    <p>This scenario could be accommodated using a number of chained
       listeners, that tie the properties together. For example, if
       there are objects of a class a, b, c e.t.c, where "a" has an
       object b [a.setFriend(b)], b an object of c and so on, then the
       listener structure would typically be:
       a&#65279;-&#65279;>b&#65279;-&#65279;>c&#65279;-&#65279;>d,
       where d.setFriend(e) would eventually be propogated to a. The
       problem in a multi-threaded system is if, for example,
       d.setFriend(e) and b.setFriend(g) were called at the same
       time. While adjusting the listeners for b, e's event may make
       some progress up the chain and encounter an out of date
       listener link, leading to inconsistent or corrupted data.<p>

    <p><center><img src="images/cached_graph.png"></center></p>

    <p>Of course, the friend classes of the objects depicted above,
       need not be objects of the same class as the original. This
       would more likely be the case in a real-world application, for
       example, class "a" might have a property price, which is a
       Price class object. The Price class object may have properties
       dependent on CurrentInterestRates and CurrentRisk class
       objects. All of these objects are observable<sup>1</sup> and a
       change in any one of them would have to be propogated back to
       the original object a.</p>

    <p>Cached Object Graph overcomes the problem of maintaing accurate
       listener links, and guarantess the integrity of the data that
       it returns. This is acheived using a copy (cache!) of the
       underlying reference graph. Only completely propogated changes are
       returned.</p>

    <p>An observable object is registered as the root object for a
       Cached Object Graph, then rather than registering any listeners
       directly on the object's properties, they are registered with
       the Cached Object Graph instead together with a path specifier
       for the property that you're interested in. (For example a path
       might be a.friend.friend.foo or in a more real-world context
       a.price.currentInterestRates.) You can add as many root objects
       as you like to a single Cached Object Graph object. The Bhavaya
       GUI typically displays objects of a given class in a
       table. Within Bhavaya, one Cached Object Graph object is used
       for a table. Class properties (a registered root object's
       observables) are displayed in the table's columns and there is
       a row for each root object registered with the Cached Object
       Graph object.</p>

    <p>CachedObjectGraph can operate in "synchronous" or "asynchronous"
       modes. This relates to whether events are propagated on the same
       thread as they occur on, and whether requests to a previously
       unmonitored area call the bean "getters" in the same thread.
       This is relevant when you may have getters with a high time cost
       (e.g. database access). In asynchronous mode, CachedObjectGraph 
       will return the special (final static) "LOADING" object if the
       underlying bean getter has not returned yet. An event will be
       issued when the method returns and the value moves from "LOADING"
       to its real value. In asynchronous mode, the concept of "row ready
       listeners" are available. The functionality was added due to a
       requirement then new rows in a table (backed by COG) did not start
       with all cells showing "loading...". In order to solve this, if you
       add a "RowReadyListener" to a COG, it will set up a mechanism to notify
       the listener when all vivible properties of a given root object are no
       longer "Loading" but show the correct value. In a synchronous COG, there
       is not multithreading for accesses to the graph, and therefore no need
       for a RowReadyListener.</p>

    <p>propertyPaths are Strings of the form "a.b.g.foo" or
       "a.b.c.d.friend.foo", as taken from the figure above, and refer
       to the property the user is interested in, in relation to the
       root object a. It is assumed that if you call a.b, that a has
       methods getB and setB, i.e. the string would actually be
       translated into a.getB.</p>

    <p>In asynchronous mode, Cached Object Graph will not block
       waiting for an object's properties, instead a new thread will
       be created for each property requested. For example, if
       "a.b.g.foo" actually results in a database query, with
       asynchronous set to true the value displayed will be
       "Loading..." until it is ready, and all other queries will also
       be initiated.</p>
