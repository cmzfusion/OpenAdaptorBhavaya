      <p>Bhavaya's components can be grouped into three areas:

      <ul>

	<li><a href="#persistence_layer">The Persistence Layer</a> Realtime
            object-relational mapping.</li>

	<li><a href="#user_interface">User Interface</a> A collection

 <a name="persistence_layer">
 <h4>The Persistence Layer</h4>
 </a>

    <p>To developers, Bhavaya is mainly a persistence layer, providing
       an object-relational mapping which is real-time. Records from
       the database are inflated into Java objects (or JavaBeans) in
       the client-side Java Virtual Machine. One or more tables in a
       database correspond to a Java class and columns in a table corresponds
       to properties of that class.</p>

    <p>Bhavaya can use classes you provide to it and inflate them with
       data from the database, or it can synthesise classes itself
       based on the columns in the tables of a database (note, column
       and table names do not have to match class and property
       names). The most common use is a combination of the above:
       where the interesting part of a class is written by hand and
       used as an abstract superclass for a subclass that Bhavaya can
       synthesise from database metadata. Bhavaya synthesises classes
       at runtime, i.e. classes are not stored in class files; they
       are generated and loaded directly into the virtual
       machine. (The BCEL class library is used for this.)</p>

    <p>Mapping to JavaBeans was used for the following reasons:</p>

    <div id="domainhome" class="app">
      <div class="h3" id="domaincontent">It minimises client memory usage. (The
        popular alternative: using a generic data structure (like a HashMap)
        typically requires wrapper objects which are much more expensive). </div>

    <div id="domainhome" class="app">
      <div class="h3" id="domaincontent">It is fast. Methods like <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">getFoo()</font>,
        do not need to be wrapped or unwrapped and are often inlined by
        the virtual machine - making data access run at the same speed
        as accessing a member variable in Java. </div>

  <li>
    <div id="domainhome" class="app">
      <div class="h3" id="domaincontent">It is easy to work with, providing a

   <h5>&nbsp;Database communication - real time updates</h5>

   <p>Bhavaya monitors the sql commands issued to the database
      to keep its objects, that have been inflated from the database,
      current. Bhavaya's sql interpreter is minimal, requiring
      sql statements that only affect one row of the database (that
      is, they should contain a "where" clause that references a
      primary key entry of a particular row). Such sql statements are
      commonly available from the middle tier in a three tier architecture,
      or directly from a database transaction log or audit trail.</p>

   <p>One solution used with Sybase databases is where the database
      has a secondary database to which the first is replicated.
      Auditing is switched on in the secondary database. The audit
      log tables of the secondary are automatically populated with sql
      statements that only apply to one row of the data. E.g. if an
      update statement affecting multiple rows is issued on the
      primary database, the audit log tables of the secondary database
      will contain multiple statements each affecting a single
      row. Bhavaya contains a small program which monitors these audit
      log tables and broadcasts the sql statements to all Bhavaya
      clients. If you write or know of others solution for
      automatically extracting sql applied to databases then please
      let us know via the <a href="feedback.html">feedback</a>

    <p>Bhavaya&#146;s presentation layer is a small collection of
       components which display tabular data: a JTable derivative that
       flashes cells when they change value, a TableSorter for sorting
       data, etc. We use the excellent JFreeChart package for our
       graphing and have written some wrappers for its interfaces so
       that its charts can easily be attached to Bhavaya's internal
       data structures (collections of beans).</p>
