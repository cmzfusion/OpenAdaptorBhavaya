   <h4>User Interface</h4>

   <h5>&nbsp;GUI Class Overview</h5>

   <p>The complete user interface is constructed from a number of
       views. A view is a component of the GUI, for example, a tab
       pane or a panel. Each view has its own associated components
       which can be found using e.g. getMenu, getComponent,
       getToolbars on that view. Each view also has a ViewContext that
       contains context sensitive information. For example, right
       clicking on a particular row of the table produces a menu of
       the sorting actions that can be performed on that bean. The
       right click action for this view depends on the contents of the
       table being displayed.</p>

    <p>The "main" class is responsible for starting the
       application. Two of its most important objects are
       ApplicationContext and Workspace.</p>
 
    <p>The ApplicationContext defines the components of the GUI
       (views) that are always there. These views can be accessed via
       the method getApplicationView. ApplicationContext is usually
       generated by extending the DefaultApplicationContext class. The
       particular ApplicationContext to load is specified in the
       configuration file application.xml.</p>
 
    <p>The Workspace object records the workspace configuration, that
       is, the states of all of the views that the user can
       change. For example, which windows were open, where they are on
       the screen e.t.c. In other words the workspace object records
       the state of the GUI.</p>
  
    <p>One of the main components of the GUI is the central table
       display. Its class hierarchy is shown below.</p>

    <p>The BeanCollection Table View displays the BeanCollection
       objects from the <a href="persistence.html#storage">Bhavaya
       Persistence layer</a>. The Highlighted Table implements
       the cell flashing when their data changes. The AnalyticsTable
       provides analytic functionality for the table's columns.</p>
      
    <p>A Chainable Table Model may be used as input to another
       Chainable Table Model. In this way, a table's data can be
       processed through a number of different table models before
       being displayed. This allows considerable flexibility in the
       operations and the order of operations that can be performed
       on the table's data. Each of the Chainable Table Models
       provides a different analytical function as their name
       suggests. Models that are available include: sorting, grouping
       and pivoting.</p>

    <p>The grouping table model discovers the way that entries are to
       be merged into buckets from options in application.xml. The way
       to group a specific data type can be specified, e.g. int
       (add/average), string (match case insensitive).</p>
